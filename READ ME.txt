Preparation:

Data Loading:
The data was originally seperated into multiple files, for some reason, such as a training and testing set, a list of subjects and list of factors.

The first step was simply to load the data into R.

Combining Data:
The measurement data was combined with subject and activity and renamed appropriately.

The name of the factors was taken from the factors_txt original file.

Filtering Variables:

We then filtered the data to variables that included either a mean or standard deviation.

Exporting Tidy Data:

We then exported the new tidy dataset. This dataset is the average measurment for variables originally containing a mean or standard deviation by subject and activity.

Files:

#The code book for the project.

run_analysis.R The R Code for the assignment

Aggregated Data:

We then aggregated the data to take the mean of a varibale by subject number (1-30) and by activity.
