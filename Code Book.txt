Code Book:

The data from the UCI dataset was consoilidated into 81 variables. In the testing 30 subjects were measured using wearable technology doing a variety of activities.
Once the data was collected we then filtered using regular expressions to variables with either mean or standard deviation. We then aggregated them by subject and activity.

Variables:

Subject Number= The ID number of the 30 subjects involved
Activity= The Activity the subject was performing "Walking","Walking Upstairs","Walking Downstairs","Sitting","Standing","lying"
